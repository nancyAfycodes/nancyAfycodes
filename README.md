- 👋 Hi, My name is Nancy and I'm a recent graduate student from CSU Northridge, where I obtained my MS in Computer Science. I have taken courses in C, C++, Java, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, Python and R. Introduction to the named programming languages have been through educational(courses) and Youtube tutorials. 
The projects completed are from coursework, hackathons and personal projects.
