- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, My name is Nancy and I'm currently a graduate student at CSUN, obtaining my MS in Computer Science. I have taken courses in C, C++, Java, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, Python and R. Introduction to the named programming languages have been through educational(courses) and Youtube tutorials. 
I am looking forward in improving upon my coursework. I am interested in the field of Data Science/Data Analysis.
